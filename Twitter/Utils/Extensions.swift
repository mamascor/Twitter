 --None Label Views--
 -When working with constraints, you always need an x-axis anchor and a y-axis anchor.
 -When working with views such as button or other kind of views that dont involved text, you always need to set a width and height property
 -MUST BE GIVEN X-AXIS, Y-AXIS, WIDTH AND HEIGHT PROPERTIES
 
 
 --Label Views--
 -When working with a label, you dont need to set width and height properties because xcode with figure that out for you.
